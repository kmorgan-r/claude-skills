.SYNOPSIS
Sends this Claude Code session's own transcript to an Anthropic model for
advice, from a session whose backend is not Anthropic.

.DESCRIPTION
`ollama launch claude` exports ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL, ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN and all
three ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{OPUS,SONNET,HAIKU}_MODEL vars, so one process serves
exactly one model from one endpoint. The built-in advisor tool is disabled there
by the model catalog, and registering it would only get GLM advising GLM. So the
advisor is a child process with a scrubbed environment, pointed back at
Anthropic.

Exit codes: 0 advice returned, 1 the wrapper refused before spawning,
2 the call was attempted and its result is not trustworthy.

# as disabled, so a broken config fails closed rather than spending money.

# -isnot [bool], not -ne $true: when $cfgRaw.enabled is an array, `-ne`
# array-filters instead of comparing, returning a (possibly empty) collection
# that `if` then coerces to false - so `{"enabled": []}` or
# `{"enabled": [true,false]}` would fail OPEN and spend money. `-isnot [bool]`
# does not array-filter: `@() -isnot [bool]` is `$true`, so the gate fires.
# This also closes `"enabled": "true"` and `"enabled": 1`, which is a
# deliberate tightening, not a regression - every real config path
# (advisor-bridge.example.json, and the `on` command writing through
# ConvertTo-Json) produces a genuine JSON boolean.
